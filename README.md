# SMARTKARE

  An IOT project focused on solving the difficulties of elderly persons especially those who suffer from Alzheimerâ€™s and those who are bedridden. Our system focuses on providing them with timely food, medicines and also does regular monitoring of their health, also monitors the medicine stock, reminds and automatically buys and stocks medicine before they get exhausted. 
  This system regularly monitors client/patient's health condition such as blood sugar, pressure, and heart rate and automatically informs concerned family members as well as the hospital in case of emergency. The system also includes a smart reminder system for regular intake of food and medicines. It also reminds about the dates and appointments for a regular checkup which has to be done at the hospital and auto generates an appointment at the earlist date available. Also, the medicine storage rack is designed in such a way that only the required medicines are given at each timing along with the reminder alarm.
